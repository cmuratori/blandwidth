/* TODO(casey):

   Currently, there are few things missing that are important for gaining
   insight into how different x64 architectures supply bandwidth.  Future
   versions of Blandwidth should add:
   
   1) Logical core affinity and scattered test patterns to measure the
      difference between cores as well as the differences when a core
      has two hyperthreads vs. one.
      
   2) Reading out of small buffers but writing into large ones, and
      reading out of large buffers but writing into small ones, since
      these patterns may change the behavior.
      
   3) Randomized read/write offsets, to measure the bandwidth when the
      CPU cannot predict the next offset.
      
   4) Reading and writing the same buffer, instead of reading from
      one buffer and writing to another.
      
   In addition, there are some general quality problems that I expect could
   be improved:
   
   1) The current "starting gate" system for trying to make multiple threads
      start processing at roughly the same time is not particularly good.
      Perhaps RDTSC should be used instead of QueryPerformanceCounter, but
      really it probably doesn't actually help one way or the other, and
      the ideal thing would be an OS strobe of some kind.
      
   2) There hasn't been any real CPUID testing, so it may be erroneously
      enabling AVX when it should not.  I did not use the try/except formulation
      here because doing so requires implementing a stack handler, which
      I didn't think was worth it.
      
   3) It's unclear that timestamps should bother with RDTSC at all, since
      it is not currently used for statistics and it is not as stable with
      respect to core boosting as QueryPerformanceCounter should theoretically
      be.  Perhaps switch to just counters, no clocks, for the stats?
